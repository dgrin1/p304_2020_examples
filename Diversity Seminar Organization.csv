I would love to organize these seminars around a lot of the research, experiences, and realities I have read, heard, and lived regarding the physics environment. The seminar would compliment my thesis very nicely (at the moment it is titled Feminist and Queer Perspectives on Physics, and I use an intersectionality approach birthed from Black Feminism). I believe I can also gain valuable experience from organizing the diversity seminars that will prepare me for future careers I would like to pursue in physics diversity. Finally, as a member and co-founder of the Physics and Astronomy Student Group, I am committed to changing the physics culture so that there is not only a space for underrepresented students, but also that they are seen as invaluable members of the physics community. ","identity in STEM, colonial history of physics, inclusive teaching methods, classroom dynamics, faculty diversity, underrepresentation in the workplace and career-wise, student's and worker's rights in the face of discrimination, confrontation techniques for both bystanders and the harmed party"

Throughout history, underrepresented groups have often been denied the recognition, resources, or education that they need, especially in a white, cis, heterosexual, male field like Physics. What is even more unbelievable is that many of those antiquated ideologies and practices have translated themselves into a modern context in the form of implicit racism, segregation, exclusion, etc. I want to work in any way possible to alleviate these issues and increase diversity within the department.","I would like to discuss how diversity can be directly incorporated into the curriculum. For example, the inclusion of uncredited seminar-style classes that teach the history of underrepresented groups in Physics/Astronomy.  Also increasing the visibility of programs (on and off campus) that are geared towards underrepresented groups to motivate them to continue pursuing a degree in Physics/Astronomy. Additionally, I recently founded Haverford's first STEM Journal and would love for there to be a section spotlighting the work of underrepresented students/faculty (this project could include interviews, short bios, photos, etc.)."

"2021/02/05 5:34:41 PM EST","Frankie","Silvers","I have been working with other students in PASG on these issues since the strike, along with being involved in other forms of student organizing, and would love to continue that work in tandem with my major. I am also a history double major with physics/astro, working on an interdisciplinary thesis project around issues of diversity, inclusion, accessibility, and liberation historically in physics and astronomy, specifically some interrogation into how narratives around diversity can mask other forms of oppression and colonialism. see below! I also acknowledge that although I hold some marginalized identities, I am a white student and not on work study, which I think are the more relevant to this topic. This position should go first to students of color, especially black students, and to students for whom this income would be more significant. ","I would really like to discuss the limits of diversity narratives, and how colleges and similar institutions tend to lean on diversity rather than the more complex narratives of oppression and liberation, and also how pushing for diversity without doing the work for accessibility ~first~ can result in simply putting marginalized students in unsafe or uncomfortable spaces. I'd also like to talk about how as a department it is our responsibility to be inclusive of all identities and backgrounds and make that effort towards accessible diversity, but also that as a department these issues go beyond who is doing the physics, and include the actual physics we are doing. Science and technology are incredibly powerful tools that can be harnessed in countless ways. As a ""prestigious"" educational institution we also need to be thinking about how we are sending young physics/science students out into the world, and what work we are prepared to do. This means making sure Haverford physics students don't just exist in a diverse environment, but are also committed to inclusion, equity, and liberation in the teaching, research, experimentation, engineering, or whatever else they go on to do. How can physics, and advanced scientific technology as a whole, be used for moral purposes? For abolition? For resistance? How are they being used now as tools of imperialism, militarism, and surveillance? These are issues of diversity and inclusion as well I believe. Physics can contribute to oppressive structures, no matter who is doing it. I have lots more thoughts on this that I'm not sure I can get out in a concise manner!  "
